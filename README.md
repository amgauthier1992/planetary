## Planetary - Work In Progress

Planetary is an interactive web application built using React Three Fiber that provides a captivating 3D representation of our solar system. Users can explore the planets and other celestial bodies in stunning detail, navigating through space with intuitive controls. Each celestial body is accompanied by fascinating facts and information, allowing users to learn about the characteristics, composition, and history of our solar system. Whether you're a space enthusiast or a curious learner, Planetary offers an engaging and educational journey through the cosmos.

### MVP Deployed

As-of May 6th, 2024, v1.0 of Planetary has been deployed! Features included in this initial main version are:

- Interactive scene that contains all the major celestial bodies in our solar system
- Basic orbit controls allowing the user to navigate around the scene using a mouse
- Added behavior to celestial bodies that enables a modal pop-up which contains pertinent facts about each body/planet mesh
- User-controlled ambient background audio

### Future Developments / In Progress

- Add more "fun facts" to each planet/celestial body
- Add asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter
- Optimization of orbit controls (distance regulation, better panning behavior)
- Optimization of initial load times (Canvas elements, modal img assets, audio)
- Research/address mobile optimization & keyboard accessibility with React Three Fiber
